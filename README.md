# RockPaperScissors

This was my first Javascript project. There was a lot to learn along the way, but I managed to get it working as expected. The biggest struggles related to returning results out of functions for use later in the code, and declaring variables at the proper scope. I got the most stuck on reporting final results at the end, until I got the idea to create separate 'win' and 'loss' counters - this way I could keep the specific results messages I had. 

Revisited this project later in the course to add user interface. It was good practice with adding event listeners and using them to trigger parts of the code. I also went ahead and added a styles sheet for some extra practice getting things where I wanted them on a page and making it look a little better.
