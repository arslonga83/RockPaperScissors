# RockPaperScissors

This was my first Javascript project. There was a lot to learn along the way, but I managed to get it working as expected. The biggest struggles related to returning results out of functions for use later in the code, and declaring variables at the proper scope. I got the most stuck on reporting final results at the end, until I got the idea to create separate 'win' and 'loss' counters - this way I could keep the specific results messages I had. 

I'm expected to return to this at some point in the future and add a GUI.
